Optimization Sample Questions

This section contains a sample optimization problem titled "Hansen Controls 1." The problem involves Hansen Controls, a company that has been awarded a contract to produce a large number of control panels. To meet this demand, the company will utilize its existing manufacturing plants located in San Diego and Houston, while also considering the establishment of new plants in Tulsa, St. Louis, and Portland. The finished control panels are to be shipped to three destinations: Seattle, Denver, and Kansas City.

Relevant information for solving the problem is provided in a table, which includes the following details:

Annual fixed costs associated with operating each plant.

Shipping costs for transporting control panels from each source (plant) to each destination.

The annual capacity of each plant in terms of the number of control panels it can produce.

The annual demand for control panels at each destination.

The task is divided into the following parts:

Formulate an objective function to minimize the total shipment costs and include the relevant constraints. Ensure to define the decision variables clearly.

This problem serves as an example for applying optimization techniques, such as linear programming, to real-world logistics and resource allocation scenarios.
